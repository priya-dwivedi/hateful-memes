## Hateful Memes Model

### Training using VisualBERT

This Github includes the notebooks for our project submission. The work was done by 3 people:

* Priyanka Dwivedi
* Daniel Heredia
* Lichen Wu

The code includes notebooks for:
1. Training a Roberta text Classifier on Hateful Memes dataset
2. Building and Training a VisualBERT classifier on Hateful Memes dataset
3. Extending VisualBERT to use ViT to generate visual embeddings
4. Experiment 1 - Using FairFace Classifier to extract race and gender information
5. Experiment 2 - Using AugLy to augment images
6. Experiment 3 - Using synthetic data to introduce positive examples in the training set
